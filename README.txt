# Teeny Tiny Compiler in C#
This project is a C#.Net Core 3.1 version of [Austin Z. Henley](https://github.com/AZHenley) fantastic [Teeny Tiny Compiler tutorial](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html). The code in this repository is the finished product from each part of the tutorial and matches the Python code as closely as I could.

I decided to forego any C#-specific syntactic sugar so that the code closely matches Austin's original. Hopefully, anyone else out there that found the tutorial fascinating but knows C# better than Python will find this useful.

## What To do
Visit each part of the tutorial to read the code explanation and reference either the original Python or this C# code.
